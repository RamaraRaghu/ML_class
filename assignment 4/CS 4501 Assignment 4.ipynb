The main difference between the three models is in the size and number of the hidden layers.The first model had 2 hidden layers of 500 and 100, while the second model had 3 layers starting at 500 and end the 3rd hidden layer being 100. The final model took model 1 and created a funnel, with the first hidden layer being 1000 and the second hidden layer being 100 (500 to 100 vs. 1000 to 100). The increased number of layers did not lead to better performance over the other 2 models. Funneling led ot a higher test accuracy score.\n"

Using a learning rate any significant size larger for me ended with NAN results, which worries me. I thus could not mess with learning rate to improve my model. The main changes I have done were to implement batche normalisations at every stage, and to implement he at the beginning. I was unable to implement drop out stages which I believe may have been able to perform better than taditional ML techniques. Overall though, I believe my model functions decently.\n",
